#7 given a Integer N print its reverse. Print 0 is overflow 32 bit
#8 Convert Binary to Decimal. Input is Binary as string. Return decimal is Integer.
#9 Convert Decimal to Binary. Input is Decimal Num as int. Return binary as String.
#10 Convert Decimal to Hex.
#11 Find GCD of two numbers.
#12 Find GCD of two numbers recursively;
#13 Write a program to check whether a given number is an ugly number. Ugly numbers are positive numbers whose prime factors only include 2, 3, 5. For example, 6, 8 are ugly while 14 is not ugly since it includes another prime factor 7. Note that 1 is typically treated as an ugly number.

 #20 write a method to return length of longest substring of unique characters.
      Ex: "abcdabcbab" o/p= 4 (abcd)
 #21 Find the left and right rotation of given string by a number k
      mypencil left rotated by 3 is
      encilmyp
      mypencil right rotated by 3 is
      cilmypen
#21 Find if given two strings are anagram. Two strings are anagram is they have same characters with same frequency
        ex: listen and silent are anagram strings as all characters are same with same freq.

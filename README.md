#1 given a number return true if its prime else false;
#2 given a number N find all primes less than N;
#3 given low and high find all prime between low and high
#4 given low and high find sum of all primes

#7 given a Integer N print its reverse. Print 0 is overflow 32 bit
#8 Convert Binary to Decimal. Input is Binary as string. Return decimal is Integer.
#9 Convert Decimal to Binary. Input is Decimal Num as int. Return binary as String.
#10 Convert Decimal to Hex.
#11 Find GCD of two numbers.
#12 Find GCD of two numbers recursively;
#13 Write a program to check whether a given number is an ugly number. Ugly numbers are positive numbers whose prime factors only include 2, 3, 5. For example, 6, 8 are ugly while 14 is not ugly since it includes another prime factor 7. Note that 1 is typically treated as an ugly number.

#14 Find the sum of first N natural numbers using recursion
#15 Write a recursive function pow(a,b) to calculate a^b.
#16 The problem is to count all the possible paths from top left to bottom right of a mXn matrix with the constraints that from each cell you can either move only to right or down.
